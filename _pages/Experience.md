I have worked with interesting people. Here are a few places where I have worked.

## Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University
<i>Mentor:</i> [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/katia-sycara/) and [Dr. Dana Hughes](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/dana-hughes/)<br>
<i>Lab:</i>[Advanced Agent Robotics Technology Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/advanced-agent-robotics-technology-lab/)<br>
<i>Project:</i> Explanation for Multi-Agent Search and Rescue Task<br>
* Working on modeling the beliefs possessed by agents using a Multi-Observer model thus interpreting the decisions
taken by them in a multi-agent team setting in a search and rescue task simulated in the Minecraft environment.

## Microsoft Research, New York City
<i>Mentor:</i> [Pavithra Srinath](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pasrinat/) and [Olga Vrousgou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/olvrousg/)<br>
<i>Team:</i>Real World Reinforcement Learning Team<br>
<i>Project:</i> Empirical Analysis of Privacy Preserving Learning<br>
* Analyzing the eect of aggregated learning (i.e. saving only those features after training that have crossed a
certain threshold of users) on the model learning capabilities of the Open Source library VowpalWabbit.

## Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
<i>Mentor:</i> Prof. Shalabh Bhatnagar<br>
<i>Project:</i> Reinforcement Learning for Scheduling Railway Lines<br>
* Worked on evaluating widely used single-agent approaches, such as Dueling Deep Q Networks (DDQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), using distributed scalable implementations from RLlib, to identify their shortcomings on the multi-agent Flatland Environment for ecient train scheduling.
* Reviewed the existing literature on Markov Decision Process (MDP) for Vehicle Rescheduling Problem and the algorithms developed to solve the problem specifically catering to the scheduling of trains.

## Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur
<i>Mentor:</i> Prof. Niloy Ganguly<br>
<i>Lab:</i> Complex Networks Research Group<br>
<i>Project:</i> Class Activation Maps for predicting Textual Entailment<br>
* Experimented with Class Activation Maps in NLP to understand the words affcting the textual entailment prediction being made by the CNN model on the SNLI dataset consisting of 570k sentence pairs. Achieved a 60% test accuracy. 
* Built a preprocessing pipeline for tweets on ebola for classication of their GloVe embeddings with Bidirectional LSTM.

I have worked with interesting people. Here are a few places where I have worked.

### Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University <img style="float: right;" src="/images/cmu ri.gif" width="175">
<i>Mentor:</i> <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/katia-sycara/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Prof. Katia Sycara</a> and <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/dana-hughes/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Dana Hughes</a> <br>
<i>Lab:</i> <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/advanced-agent-robotics-technology-lab/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Advanced Agent Robotics Technology Lab</a><br>
<i>Project:</i> Explanation for Multi-Agent Search and Rescue Task<br> 

[comment]: <> (<i>Program:</i> [Robotics Institute Summer Scholar Program 2021](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) <br>)

* Working on modeling the beliefs possessed by agents using a Multiple-Observer model thus interpreting the decisions taken by them in a multi-agent team setting in a search and rescue task simulated in the Minecraft environment. 

### Microsoft Research, New York City <img style="float: right;" src="/images/msr.png" width="150">
<i>Mentor:</i> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/olvrousg/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Olga Vrousgou</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pasrinat/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Pavithra Srinath</a><br>
<i>Team:</i> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/real-world-reinforcement-learning/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Real World Reinforcement Learning Team</a><br>
<i>Project:</i> Empirical Analysis of Privacy Preserving Learning<br>

[//]: # (<i>Program:</i> [Reinforcement Learning Open Source Fest 2021](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/rl-open-source-fest/) <br>)

* Analyzed the effect of Aggregated Learning (i.e. saving only those features after training that have crossed a
certain threshold of users) on the model learning capabilities of the Open Source library VowpalWabbit.
* Achieved competitive performance between the public model (does not have access to the user feature mapping) and private model (has access to the user feature mapping) on the OpenML Click Prediction Dataset. 

### Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore <img style="float: right;" src="/images/iisc.png" width="90">
<i>Mentor:</i> <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~shalabh/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Prof. Shalabh Bhatnagar</a><br>
<i>Project:</i> Reinforcement Learning for Scheduling Railway Lines<br>

[//]: # (<i>Program:</i> [Indian Academy of Sciences Summer Research Fellowship 2020](https://web-japps.ias.ac.in:8443/fellowship2020/index.html) <br>)

* Worked on evaluating widely used single-agent approaches, such as Dueling Deep Q Networks (DDQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), using distributed scalable implementations from RLlib, to identify their shortcomings on the multi-agent Flatland Environment for efficient train scheduling.
* Reviewed the existing literature on Markov Decision Process (MDP) for Vehicle Rescheduling Problem and the algorithms developed to solve the problem specifically catering to the scheduling of trains.

### Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur <img style="float: right;" src="/images/iitkgp.png" width="90">
<i>Mentor:</i> <a href="http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Prof. Niloy Ganguly</a><br>
<i>Lab:</i> <a href="https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Complex Networks Research Group</a><br>
<i>Project:</i> Class Activation Maps for predicting Textual Entailment<br>
* Experimented with Class Activation Maps in NLP to understand the words affcting the textual entailment prediction being made by the CNN model on the SNLI dataset consisting of 570k sentence pairs. Achieved a 60% test accuracy. 
* Built a preprocessing pipeline for tweets on ebola for classification of their GloVe embeddings with Bidirectional LSTM.
